# Livestock-water-usage-analysis
This is a graph that I created in my Foundations of Engineering class at Virginia Tech.  I was given data about livestock water usage from a CSV file. I transferred that data into MATLAB and made a line graph with a line of best fit showing the trend of livestock water usage over a time period of 50 years.
